## Introduction
### Preface

I loved the [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) framework. However it's getting bulky (it iis still very light-weight, just more than I needed) and not very friendly (to me). And I had to work on a server with php4.01 only (!)(although the support of php4 is continuously removed in this framework) and CI just do not fit. Therefore I referred to CI and write my own simple framework to support my daily works, which includes writing many small websites, mainly form handling and other events websites. This file documents what is going on in using this framework and will probably serve just as a note to myself.

I don't like OO programming much. Therefore in this framework mostly are procedural functions and logic. No MVC, No OOP. Simple and sweet. Perhaps not very sweet, but enough to do my tasks quickly and easily. Although some helpers adopted are really in OO style, I don't really hate it, but I will wrap it as procedural functions.  

What WS stands for? Although this is built for my job, the first completed mini "project" is my personal "WorkSpace".

--------


### License

I did not set any license to this framework for the time being (as of 2015-12-23).  

However, as some functions and code snippets are taken and modified from CodeIgniter and other open-sourced projects, I suppose this should be open-sourced. You may use it under any suitable open-licenses (perhaps MIT license? I am not sure).  

I only claim that as the author of this framework this can be changed at any time without prior notices, and I keep the copyright of this framework, except those functions, scripts or code snippets otherwise specified in the code.

### Code Style


```
function( $var , $var2 )
{
	$x = $a + $b;
	return TRUE;
}

$tmp = fx1( fx2( fx3( $var1 ) , $var2 ) );
```
- Brackets, open brackets stick together with its "owner", and 1 space between the "arguments"
- Commas in function are separated with *everything* by 1 space
- Curly brackets in new lines
- Boolean Data Type: TRUE / FALSE / NULL in CAPS

--------


## Using the Framework

As this is a self-defined framework, many stuff has been "pre-defined" and have "opinionated values" (or, simply "hard-coded") to make things work in an efficient way. Therefore, please read the following sections on how to use it.

Note: This framework is built with the support to Bootstrap (v3). Support to v4 is not implemented. Some functions (on displaying content) are normally defined with Bootstrap classes.



--------


### Pages and Segments

All "pages" of the application should goes in the **pages** directory. For instance, create a "test.php" and you can access it in the web by *http://your-site.com/test*. You may also make sub-directories as needed (but this is not very thoroughly tested).  

You can use add argument to the url with `/`.  

Consider this url:  http://your-site.com/test/arg1/hello  

If you do not have the file `/pages/test/arg1/hello.php` but only `/pages/test.php`, then you can access the rest of the url segment as arguments by using `segments()`. In this case, `segments(0)` will return `'arg1'` and `segments(1)` will return `'hello'`. Please refer to [Core > Segments](#segments) section below for details.  



--------


### .htaccess

Please edit the `.htaccess` file in the root of the framework. There are 2 sections which you should modify on each application:



--------


#### RewriteBase

Please search for "RewriteBase" and change the path based on your application root (i.e. where index.php locates). This is essential otherwise the application will just die except the default page.



--------


#### Options to rewrite `www.`

There are two options:  
Option 1: rewrite www.example.com → example.com  
Option 2: rewrite example.com → www.example.com  
Choose one of them and comment out the other section.  



--------




--------


### Templates

The framework applies the same header and footer template to all the page.  
Please edit `header.inc.php` and `footer.inc.php` as needed.  
(Also read [Loader Settings](#loader-settings) section below.)



--------


### index.php

The index.php is served as a "base loader" to load the pages. Do not edit if you are not sure what's going on. Put your application pages in `/pages/` directory.  



--------


#### Multiple Instances

You can have multiple instances of index.php in different directories, and share the same system files. In this framework, we assumes that all these instances belong to the same application with minor settings modifications. On the contrary, if you share the same system files across multiple applications, it will be scary if you need to update the core!



--------


#### Loader Settings

The user adjustable settings are as follows: (in index.php)

--------

**$ws_loader['basepath']**  
Specify the application base path, which is the container directory of "core", "config", "pages" directories. If this is empty, it will use the current index.php file path. You can use relative (to this file) path or absolute path here. Do not put trailing slash. 

Examples:
```php
$ws_loader['basepath'] = '';		// default

$ws_loader['basepath'] = '..';
// parent dir, useful when you put 2nd instance of index.php in sub-directories.
// you can refer to the 2nd example of Page Dir below

$ws_loader['basepath'] = '/var/www/ws';		// absolute path
```

--------

**$ws_loader['pages_dir']**  
Specify the "pages" directory, where the application pages locates. The path is relative to the Application Root path specified above. Do not put trailing slash.

Examples:
```php
$ws_loader['pages_dir'] = '';		// default, which points to "pages"

$ws_loader['pages_dir'] = 'admin';
// if this index.php is a 2nd instance and in a sub-dir called "admin".

```

--------

**$ws_loader['settings']**  
Generally speaking, most of the time you only need a single instance of index.php so that this is not used. However, when you put up a 2nd instance, some times the settings you have made in config.in.php may not be valid / applicable to that instance. Therefore, you need to override it to make it usable. One line for each settings.

Examples:
```php
$ws_loader['settings']['title'] = 'Admin Only Page';
$ws_loader['settings']['valid_users'] = 'Admin';
```

--------

**$ws_loader['incl_header'] / $ws_loader['incl_footer']**  
Specify if you would include header and footer (header.inc.php / footer.inc.php).  By design, this should be enabled.

However this is useful if there is some page in the application that a site header/footer should not be displayed. You will need to write your own includes by using incl().

Please note the styles of 404 page, if you are not including or not using index.

Specify TRUE or FALSE in the variables.




--------




--------


### Pre-defined Variables and Aliases

All system variables begin with `$ws_` prefix. Do not create / overwrite / modify these variables. You can refer to the index.php for a list of system variables.

There are some other pre-defined aliases of variables / constants to simplify your codes:

Var/Const  | Description of the Alias
---------- | ------------------------
`$P`       | (CAPITAL P) alias for `$_POST`
`$G`       | (CAPITAL G) alias for `$_GET`
`$F`       | (CAPTIAL F) alias for `$_FILES`
`$S`       | (CAPITAL S) alias for `$_SERVER`
`DS`       | alias for `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`

Note: What I meant for *alias* here, is that you can keep modifying these variables (e.g. `$P`), while keeping the original one intact (e.g. `$_POST` is unchanged). It is sometimes useful to have 2 copies of the same data to manipulate the program easily. A shorter variable name of these commonly used variables can increase readabilty. For instance, it is clumpsy if the code is flooded with `$_POST['surname']` , `$_POST['name']`, etc. (consider having over 5 or 10 like these), but a bit more readable by `$P['surname']`, `$P['name']`, etc.



--------


### Commonly Used Stuff to Note

- Page Title
	- Use [`set_page_title()`](#set_page_title) to set page title. Useful for pages that you would like an separate page heading. The position is defined in *header.inc.php* with **%PAGE_TITLE%** tag. (i.e., you can use `set_page_title()` anywhere in the page and the title will be set for you)
- Add select options
	- Use [`add_options_set()`](#add_options_set) to add new options. See also [options](#7-options) section in bs_form_helper section.
- Add new JavaScript blocks
	- Use [`addjs()`](#addjs) to add new JavaScript block inline with the program codes in a page. This is required as JavaScript is loaded *AFTER* page content. A `<script></script>` tag will be wrapped for each array item. The scripts are printed in *footer.inc.php* with [`printjs()`](#printjs).



--------


#### CSV, TSV and Array

Array is commonly used in php and in this framework. However, typing arrays sometimes is not very efficient if it is a multi-dimensional array. Thus sometimes tab-separated values (TSV) is used in place of 2-dimensional arrays, with the aid of [`tsv2array()`](#tsv2array) helper. Also, sometimes it is easier to list a set of items in comma-separated values (CSV). Thus, most helper functions supports an auto conversion of csv to array for its arguments (with [`csv2array()`](#csv2array)). That is, if the function's argument requires an array (but not associative array), you can use CSV. However, please check the function's API doc to make sure that.



--------


#### Defaults

Most of the functions have multiple optional arguments. To reduce the use of array parameter, but to skip some optional arguments in the middle, most of the helpers accepts blank string `''` to keep using default values with the introduction of [`empty_defaults()`](#empty_defaults). 




--------




--------


### File Structure

--------




--------




--------


## Config
### settings.php

All settings of the application. Most of the items are self-explanatory in comments.  
Do **NOT** delete any existing variables. Set it to blank `$config['item'] = '';` instead if it is not used.  
Note: This list may not be up-to-date. Please follow what you have in `settings.php`.  
You may also set up any site-wide settings that you can access via `config_item('example_settings')`; Please refer to [`config_item()`](#config_item).



--------


#### Auto-load Helpers

Variable                 | Description
------------------------ | -----------
`$config['helpers']`     | array of helpers to be loaded




--------


#### Title of Application

Variable                 | Description
------------------------ | -----------
`$config['title']`       | Application title, affects how to show in template header and the `<title>` tag in `<head>`
`$config['subtitle']`    | Sub title only shows in header area



--------


#### Datafile Helper
#### Admin Access

To be used by [`valid_user()`](#valid_user).

Variable                 | Description
------------------------ | -----------
`$config['valid_admin']` | Admin user names
`$config['valid_users']` | Normal users, no need to repeat admin user names

<!-- this is the deprecated version.
`$config['admin_ip']`    | IP of authorized users, to access pages protected by `valid_user()` function; *Note*: localhost user is always allowed.
`$config['admin_key']`   | Key to access pages protected by `valid_user()` function. Note that`admin_ip` takes privilege. Append `?v=the_key` to access by admin key. -->




--------


#### Dates

To be used with [`timestr()`](#timestr) / [`time_started()`](#time_started) / [`time_ended()`](#time_ended).  
You may specify any unambiguous date format, e.g. '2015-01-01 12:34'.  
On the contrary, "01-02-2015" is not advised as this could cause confusion on the order of day and month part.  
You can also define you own "date" settings, that the variable ends with '_date'.  
E.g. `$config['test_date'] = '...'`, and access via `timestr('test')`;

Variable                 | Description
------------------------ | -----------
`$config['start_date']`  | Start date of the application
`$config['end_date']`    | End date of the application

--------


### constants.php

There are a few framework constants defined. You can change the value to something else to suit your needs.  
Please do *NOT* delete any existing constants.  
You may also define your own site-wide constants in this file.  




--------




--------




--------


## Core

Core is the core library (which in essence also helpers) that the framework will not work without these functions.



--------


### URI Segments

For description of how uri segments work, please see section: [Using the Framework](#using-the-framework).



--------


#### Helper Functions

Note: segments() = csegments() + psegments().  
fsegments() is the superset of segments(). However, fsegments() do not have any portability as it is based on absolute path to the web root, while other "segments" functions rely on relative root to the application.



--------


##### segments()

`segments( [$n], [$no_result] )`

Fetch URI segments based on **application root**.    
Note: it currently has an alias `segment()`, which is deprecated and will be removed.  

**Parameters**

- [mixed **$n** = FALSE]
  - The segment item to return. *0* being the first item.
  - *FALSE* to return an array of ALL segments.
- [bool/mixed **$no_result** = FALSE]
  - What to return if no result.

**Return Values**

- *FALSE* - when segment is not found
- *Mixed* - when segment is not found and has a custom value for `$no_result`
- *String* - uri segment text
- *Array* - array of uri segments text (when `$n == FALSE` which is default)

**Examples**

All functions call with this url: `http://www.example.com/app/test/hello/arg1/arg2`,    
while *test* is the application root, *hello* is the handler page (`pages/hello.php`)  
  
```php  
$segs1 = segments();		// $segs1 = array( 'hello' , 'arg1' , 'arg2' );  
$segs2 = csegments();		// $segs2 = array( 'hello' );  
$segs3 = psegments();		// $segs3 = array( 'arg1' , 'arg2' );  
$segs4 = fsegments();		// $segs4 = array( 'app' , 'test' , 'hello' , 'arg1' , 'arg2' );  
  
echo segments(0);		// prints: hello  
echo segments(1);		// prints: arg1  
echo segments(2);		// prints: arg2  
echo segments(3);		// prints nothing since returns FALSE.  
echo segments(3, 'Not Found');		// prints: Not Found  
  
echo csegments(0);		// prints: hello  
echo csegments(1);		// prints nothing since returns FALSE.  
  
echo psegments(0);		// prints: arg1  
echo psegments(1);		// prints: arg2  
echo psegments(2);		// prints nothing since returns FALSE.  
  
echo fsegments(0);		// prints: app  
echo fsegments(1);		// prints: test  
echo fsegments(2);		// prints: hello  
echo fsegments(3);		// prints: arg1  
echo fsegments(4);		// prints: arg2  
echo fsegments(5);		// prints nothing since returns FALSE.  
```  




--------


##### csegments()

`csegments( [$n], [$no_result] )`

Similar to `segments()`, except that this returns segments based on the **<u>c</u>urrent** page.  
Note: it currently has an alias `csegment()`, which is deprecated and will be removed.  
Please refer to [segments()](#segments) for details of parameters, return values and examples.  

**Parameters**

- [mixed **$n** = FALSE]

- [bool/mixed **$no_result** = FALSE]





--------


##### psegments()

`psegments( [$n], [$no_result] )`

Similar to `segments()`, except that this returns segments for the **<u>p</u>arameters** only.  
Note: it currently has an alias `psegment()`, which is deprecated and will be removed.  
Please refer to [segments()](#segments) for details of parameters, return values and examples.  

**Parameters**

- [mixed **$n** = FALSE]

- [bool/mixed **$no_result** = FALSE]





--------


##### fsegments()

`fsegments( [$n], [$no_result] )`

Similar to `segments()`, except that this returns segments based on the **<u>f</u>ull path**.  
This is useful if your application is nested under a sub-directory.  
  
Please note that `fsegments()` does not have portability as it relies on web root instead of application root. For instance, if you move the application into a deeper sub-directory, it will have different returns.  
  
Please refer to [segments()](#segments) for details of parameters, return values and examples.  

**Parameters**

- [mixed **$n** = FALSE]

- [bool/mixed **$no_result** = FALSE]





--------


##### site_url()

`site_url( [$uri] )`

Make a proper full web address of the URI based on the **application root** defined in index.php.  
Useful for pages in `pages` with assets under other sub-folders of root (e.g. `/img/`).  
Note:   
- If the uri has a scheme (e.g. `http://` ) , it will not be prep'd.  
- If no uri is inputted, the base url will be returned.  
- If your index.php is NOT on the same level as application root, please REMEMBER to add the extra segment when you call this as this function is NOT based on current url.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$uri** = '']
  - URI to check and set

**Return Values**

- *String* - the complete url

**Examples**

  
```php  
echo site_url();		// prints: http://your_domain.com  
echo site_url( 'img/test.png');		// prints: http://your_domain.com/img/test.png  
```  




--------


##### current_url()

`current_url( [$uri] )`

Make a proper full web address of the URI based on **current page url**.  
Useful for pages in sub-folder (`pages/folder1`) with assets under the same sub-folder.  
Note:  
- If the uri has a scheme (e.g. http:// ) , it will not be prep'd.  
- If no uri is inputted, the base url will be returned.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$uri** = ""]
  - URI to check and set

**Return Values**

- *String* - the complete URL

**Examples**

  
The url is: http://your_domain.com/example/test/  
"example" is the directory where the application is located.  
"test" is the handler.  
```php  
echo current_url( 'image.png');		// prints: http://your_domain.com/pages/example/test/image.png  
echo current_url();		// prints: http://your_domain.com/pages/example/test

## Main

The main helpers contains a mix of useful functions that should be most needed by all applications, and some base functions for other functions to rely on.

This is currently put in helpers category, but in essence this is like in a mix of core and helper. Therefore this is moved out as a separate section so as for easy reference.

(The differences of "core" & "main" is defined by, if those in "main" is missing, the framework would still runs, probably in reduced functionality, while missing those in "core" cannot and the framework will die immediately.)



--------


### Development Functions

Since `die()` is frequently use in conjunction with these functions, you can specify `'die'` as one of the parameters to kill the script. (You can use the constant `DIE` and `die` as well)



--------


##### echob()

`echob( $arg1, ... )`

Print arguments in new lines with `<br>` tag.  

**Parameters**

- mixed **$arg1, ...**
  - Arguments to be printed. Strings or array of string. 'die' to `die()`. (In essence, it will also print objects using `printr()`)

**Return Values**

- *Void*

**Examples**

  
```php

Return a string of the time type in specified date format.     
The time types are defined in [settings.php - date section](#dates).  
  
This time string is useful in time comparisons.

### Miscellaneous Functions
##### die_nicely()

`die_nicely( [$text], [$caption], [$include_header] )`

Die nicely with styles. Useful to show simple error message immediately without having the need to make a new page.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$text** = '']
  - Error message content to display (wrapped with `<p>`)
- [string **$caption** = '']
  - Error message caption to display (wrapped with `<h2>`).
- [bool **$include_header** = FALSE]
  - Include header.inc.php if *TRUE* - since `header.inc.php` already included before loading the page file, the use is very limited before header is included by index.php. For instance, making a custom library and this is called before `header.inc.php` is loaded. However, if this is called too early before main helper is loaded, this function will fail to be called anyway (PHP error). 
  -  No effect if `$ws_loader['incl_header']` is FALSE. 
  - NOTE: footer is always included; again if `$ws_loader['incl_footer']` is FALSE, footer will not be included.

**Return Values**

- *Void*

**Examples**

  
```php  
if( ! valid_user() )  
{  
	die_nicely( 'You are not allowed to access this page.' , 'Access Denied');  
}  
```  




--------


##### get_require()

**Return Values**

- *String*

**Examples**

  
```php  
$result = get_require( '/some/path/to/file' );  
```  




--------


##### empty_default()

`empty_default( $value, $default )`

- *Void*

**Examples**

  
```php  
$str = '';  
empty_default( $str , '123' );		// $str = '123'  
$str2 = '456';  
empty_default( $str2 , '123' );		// $str2 = '456'  
```  




--------


##### html()

`html( $element, [$attributes], [$html_close_comment] )`

Prepare a html element.    
  
Note: This is not an intelligent function. You must give instructions if that is a self-closing element or is an element with close tag. Defaults to self-closing element (i.e. no close tag will be made).  

**Parameters**

- string **$element**
  - Element name to be printed. E.g. a, form, input, etc.
- [array **$attributes** = '']
  - Any attributes to be printed inside the open tag. Sub array items can also be array. For details please refer to [`_print_attributes()`](#_print_attributes). You may also specify '' (blank) for $attributes if no attributes to add if you need close comment (below).
- [bool **$html_close_comment** = FALSE]
  - If *TRUE*, add a html comment after close tag to make view source better. Text to add is from id and class attributes (see examples). No effect for self-closing elements.

**Return Values**

- *String* - html code generated

**Examples**

  
  
Basic usage:  
```php  
echo html( 'a' , array( 'href' => 'www.example.com', 'title' => 'Hover Text'), 'Test Website');  
// Prints: <a href="www.example.com" title="Hover Text">Test Website</a>  
  
echo html( 'div' , array( 'id' => 'div1' ) , "Test" , '/ #div1');  
// Prints: <div id="div1">Test</div> <!-- / #div1 -->  
  
echo html( 'img', array( 'src' => 'test.png' );  
// Prints: <img src="test.png">  
  
echo html( 'div', array( 'class' => 'myclass' , '' );  
// Prints: <div class="myclass"></div>  
```  
What makes this function really useful is you can modify the attributes array before generating the tag:  
```php  
$attr = array( 'class' => 'myclass' );  
if( $P['a'] == FALSE )  
{  
	$attr['class'] => 'yourclass';  
}  
echo html( 'div' , $attr , 'Sample Text' );  
// if $P['a'] is really false:  
// prints: <div class="yourclass">Sample Text</div>  
```  
You can also wrap html() into another html() just like a chain:  
```php  
echo html( 'div' , '' ,   
		html( 'h4' , '' ,   
			html( 'a' , $attr, 'A link in a h4 in a div')  
		)  
	);  
```

  - **Note:** different from [`html()`](#html) where the default is *FALSE*

**Return Values**

- *String* - html code generated

**Examples**

  
```php  
echo div( html( 'p' , '' , 'Hello World!') );  
// prints:  
// <div><p>Hello World!</p></div>

## Helpers

Helpers, as the name suggests, help you with tasks. Each helper file is a collection of functions in a particular category. Helper files located in `./helpers/`. All helper file names should ends with `_helper.php`, e.g. `array_helper.php`.

To load a helper in a page, use `load_helper( 'helper_name' );` (e.g. `load_helper('array');`). To auto-load a helper for the whole site, add the name of helper(s) in `$config['helpers']` in `settings.php`.

Since most likely we will have our own helper functions in each application (and for that specific application), a blank `local_helper.php` is here and set to auto-load by default.

### array

We deal with arrays a lot so the array helpers are here to help.



--------


##### tsv2array()

`tsv2array( $data, [$has_header], [$row_key], [$delimiter], [$convert_spaces] )`

Convert tab-separated values string to 2-dimensional array. If the data supplied is already an array, does nothing.  
  
Note: you can use `//` to comment out a row in a data for convenience.  

**Parameters**

- string **$data**
  - Delimited string data to be converted
- [bool **$has_header** = TRUE]
  - TRUE to make first array item as the key of the 2nd level array (and the first item will be removed in the array)
- [bool/string **$row_key** = TRUE]
  - If *TRUE*, search for `'id'` field (opinionated value) as the 1st level array keys. 
  -  If *FALSE*, keep numeric 1st level array keys. 
  -  If *string*, search for identifier field as specified in this value and make it as 1st level array keys. Otherwise, the first level array keys are numeric. For example, if your id field is named "row_id", you can pass this string for this parameter, so that the first level keys are properly named to make it into an associative array. Note: if same key value exists, the later ones will have the original numeric key appended after the key value, so that data will not be overwritten and appears as separate array item.
- [string **$delimiter** = "\t"]
  - Column delimiter character.
- [bool **$convert_spaces** = TRUE]
  - If *TRUE*, convert 4 consecutive spaces to tabs before conversion. Editors may replace tabs with spaces automatically.

**Return Values**

- *Array* - of data (2-dimentional array)

**Examples**

  
```php  
$data = tsv2array('  
id	name	title  
john	John Doe	Mr.  
jane	Jane Doe	Ms.  
// 3	This Record is Commented Out  
');  
  
print_r($data):  
// prints:  
// Array  
// (  
//     [john] => Array  
//         (  
//             [id] => john  
//             [name] => John Doe  
//             [title] => Mr.  
//         )  
//

### bs_form

The Bootstrap Form helper contains a standard use case to help creating forms (in B style) easily. This was developed from an old form helper (deprecated in favour of the use of B framework).

Please study the basics of Bootstrap framework before you can use these helpers properly.



--------


#### Standard Use Case

The helper is developed with the consideration of "fieldsets" with multiple fields in a fieldset. Therefore, instead of manually creating form fields individually, we can make use of an array of settings of the fieldset in tab seperated values (TSV). Consider the following code snippet:

```php
$fs1 = tsv2array('
//1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11
id	label	type	validate	desc	placeholder	options	extra	value	append	prepend
sid	Student ID	text	required,custom[integer]
password	password	password	required
');

$form_type = 'horizontal';
echo form_open( '' , $form_type );
echo form_gen_fieldset( form_set_values( $fs1, $P ), '' , $form_type );
echo form_submit( '' , $form_type );
echo form_fieldset_close();
echo form_close();
```

(Note: the number are here to help counting the tabs)

This code block creates a form with the 2 fields (sid, password), in B's horizontal form style.
The use of TSV minimizes the typing required, although in essence the functions accepts array as input. Therefore, you can also modify the array first before generating the form fields.

For the data to input in the TSV is discussed below. You can reorder the TSV, just to change order the column header in the way you prefer.

Please also refer to [`tsv2array()`](#tsv2array) in **arrays** helper. Also, please read below sections for explanations of each helper functions.

For horizontal form type, you can specify the width of label, e.g. `horizontal-6`. The element width would be the remaining width. Otherwise, for site-wide label width, you can modify the constant `HORIZONTAL_FORM_LABEL_WIDTH` in `config/constants.php`.

Please also note that there is a global form disabled state switch. Please refer to [form_disabled()](#form_disabled) for details. However, you can completely ignore it if you do not need this functionality.



--------


##### 1. id

The unique id and the name of the field.

Note: if you have to specify id and name differently, use [html()](#html) to create your own tag as this is out of the standard use case.



--------


##### 2. label

Text label to be displayed. For radio and checkbox, this will be the group label (not the label next to the select option).

If no label tag should be created, put **FALSE** as value.



--------


##### 3. type

The following describes the form element types available in this helper:

type | Description
--- | ---
hidden | a hidden field. *label* attribute has no effect
select | Standard select list make use of `<option>` tags.
select-radio | List of options in radio buttons. Only 1 option can be chosen.
select-checkbox | List of options in checkboxes. Multiple options can be made.
static | text wrapped in `<p>` tag. Specify the text in *value* attribute. The text is aligned on the element side. Note: *label* does still prints and you still need to give an unique *id* although this is not printed.
html | plain html code to output. Specify the code in *label* or *value* attribute. If both attributes are specified, *label* takes precedence and the other discards.
textarea | Standard textarea. Default *rows* = 2. Specify *rows* value in *options* (this is a special case)
checkbox | Single checkbox. Use *desc* attributes to specify text next to the checkbox.
file| Standard file upload field
text | Standard text field
All other valid HTML5 input types | Those input types must begin with `<input`.

See [7. options](#7-options) section below for select options.

Note: There is no type for a single radio option as this is not helpful at all.



--------


##### 4. validate

Add a validation class. In this framework we make use of the [jquery-validationEngine plugin](http://posabsolute.github.io/jQuery-Validation-Engine/ "Complete docs here").

Separate validation rules with comma (,).

Some common validation rules are listed below:

Rule [Keyword / E.g.] | Description
--- | ---
required | A required field
min[0.1] / max[99] | Specify min / max value of the field (value)
minSize[1] / maxSize[200] | Specify min / max character length
custom[email] | valid email address (e.g. test@example.com)
custom[phone] | valid phone (e.g. 30561309, 6543-1234, +58 295416 7216)
custom[url] | valid url address (e.g. http://..., https://..., ftp://...)
custom[date] | valid date (YYYY-MM-DD)
custom[number] | floating points (with optional sign) (e.g. -143.22, .77 , +234.23)
custom[integer] | integers (with optional sign) (e.g. -635, +2201, 738)
ipv4 | An IP (v4) address (e.g. 127.0.0.1)

Note: Multiple "custom" rules are separated with commas with square brackets. e.g. custom[phone,integer]



--------


##### 5. desc

Descriptive text show next to (or under - depends on form type) the field.



--------


##### 6. placeholder

Placeholder text show inside the field, when it is empty.



--------


##### 7. options

This attribute has effect only on the 3 select types. (Special: *options* can also specify the *rows* attribute of *textarea*, just put an integer as options for textarea.)

Options is an array with `value => description` pair in essence. However, to work nicely with TSV, you may also use `value1||desc1, value2||desc2` syntax.

- value: the value to be captured in data
- desc: the text to be shown to user on the select list / checkboxes / radio.



--------


###### a. select options


```php
add_options_set( 'options1', array(
	'1'=>'One' , '2'=>'Two',
) );
$data = tsv2array('
// 1 2 ... 7
id	label ... options
sid	Year ... $options1
');
```

There is a pre-defined `$ws_select_options` variable. You can add item in this array using [`add_options_set()`](#add_options_set) and then specify `$options1` as the option value.

To add a select option easily, you can create the options array first and then use `add_options_set()`. This is also good for those selects with same options set

Two commonly used options has been pre-defined:

1. status (same value&label: Active / Inactive / Deleted )
2. bool (value=>label: Y=>Yes / N=>No )





--------


###### b. serialized  json encoded array

The options can be specified using the `serialize()` or `json_encode()`functions. Either one is fine and the system will detect.

```php
$options1 = array('1'=>'One' , '2'=>'Two');
) ) );
$data = tsv2array('
// 1 2 ... 7
id	label ... options
sid	Year ... ' . serialize( $options1 ) . ' ...
num	Number ... ' . json_encoded( $options1 ) . '...
');
```



--------


###### c. value-desc pair

Specify in the TSV with pre-defined separator: "`||`" (two vertical bar, or <kbd>shift-\</kbd>). This is useful for simple lists.

On the other hand, for a even more simpler list (the value and desc is the same), simply put csv there.

```php
$data = tsv2array('
// 1 2 ... 7
id	label ... options
year	Year ... 1||One,2||Two ...
age	Age	..	14,15,16,17,18
');
```




--------


##### 8. extra

Any extra stuff to put *in* the field's tag. This is not filtered (except we will `trim()` and then add one space in front to the string). You can even put JavaScript call here, examples:  
`disabled`
`onclick="somescript();"`  



--------


##### 9. value

Value (initial value) of the field. For checkbox and radio the one with the value will be set checked.



--------


##### 10&11. append & prepend

Any text or code to append or prepend to the field, using [B's input group addon functionality](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#input-groups-basic).



--------


#### User Functions
##### form_open()

`form_open( [$action], [$type], [$id], [$class], [$multipart], [$extra], [$text], [$method] )`

This makes proper form open tag. It also accept an array as the first argument that include part or all of the arguments as array keys. E.g. `form_open( array( 'id'=> ... , 'action' => ... )`  

**Parameters**

- [string **$action** = '']
  - form handler. If empty, will point back to current page. `htmlentities( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] )`

```  




--------


##### form_close()

`form_close( [$text] )`

Produces a closing `</form>` tag. The only advantage to use this function is it permits you to pass data to it which will be added directly below the tag and you do not have to close php blocks.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$text** = '']
  - html code or text to add immediately after the close tag is ended `</form>\n$text...`

**Return Values**

- *String* - of HTML code

--------


##### form_gen_fieldset()

`form_gen_fieldset( $fields, [$legend], [$form_type], [$attributes] )`

Generate a fieldset with form fields in Bootstrap style.  
  
In essence, this function is simply a combination call of `form_fieldset_open()` and `form_gen_elements()`. However, to streamline the use case of the form helper, this function is essential.  
  
Note: All elements will have an auto-id generated. For instance, if the id of the field is *field1*, then the `<label>` will have an id *label_field1*, the field element (`<input>`,`<textarea>`, etc.) will have id *field1*. For select options, an auto number will be added, e.g. *field1-1* (starting from 1). There will be an auto id for input group div as well.  

**Parameters**

- array/string **$fields**
  - data of the fieldset. See [Standard User Case](#Standard-Use-Case) section.
- [string/bool **$legend** = '']
  - Text to show as the caption of the fieldset. Specify *FALSE* if no need to create the fieldset tag: `<fieldset>`.
- [enum **$form_type** = '']
  - Bootstrap form type ( '' / horizontal / inline ) 
  -  If $form_type is *horizontal*, you can also specify the label width e.g. *horizontal-4*
- [array **$attributes** = array()]
  - attributes add to fieldset open tag (e.g. id, class, ...)

**Return Values**

- *String* - html code of the whole fieldset (or fields)

**Examples**

  
```php  
$fs1 = tsv2array('  
...  
');  
echo form_gen_fieldset( $fs1, '' , $form_type );  
```  




--------


##### form_fieldset_open()

`form_fieldset_open( [$legend], [$attributes] )`

Create fieldset open tag and legend tag. Normally you will use [form_gen_fieldset()](#form_gen_fieldset) instead.

  - Text to show as the caption of the fieldset. No `<legend>` tag will be created if it is an empty string
- [array **$attributes** = array()]
  - Attributes to print in `<fieldset>` tag, e.g. id, class, etc.

**Return Values**

- *String* - of HTML code

**Examples**

  
```php  
echo form_fieldset_open();

##### form_set_value()

`form_set_value( $field, $data )`

Similar to [form_set_values()](#form_set_values). However this only set value for a single form field. Normally you will not calling this manually and you should simply specify TRUE to the last argument when using [form_element()](#form_element).  

**Parameters**

- array **$field**
  - field array (single field)
- array **$data**
  - values array (e.g. data from post or database)

--------


##### form_disabled()

`form_disabled( [$value] )`

This function has two uses (see examples):  
1. Making all form elements in disabled state (or not).  
	- Note: This is a global switch. Meaning that you can change this settings once and change for all fields.  
	- Default disabled state is FALSE. (i.e. you can completely ignore this function if you do not need this.)  
2. Returns the string `disabled` if form is in "disabled" state. (this use is designed for form field helper functions to set the disabled state.)  

**Parameters**

- [bool **$value** = '']
  - Set if the form should be disabled. 
  -  If the value is empty, it returns the string `disabled` if form is in disabled state.

**Return Values**

- *Void* - if setting disabled state (use 1)
- *String/Null* - (use 2)

**Examples**

  
```php  
// for use 1:  
form_disabled( TRUE );		// init  
if( time_started() AND ! time_ended() )  
	form_disabled( FALSE );  
```

- [mixed| '' **$label** = label text. If no label tag should be created, put `FALSE`]

- [string **$value** = '']
  - value attribute
- [array **$options** = array()]
  - other form helper input attributes (name, id, label, type, value, validate, desc, placeholder, options, extra, append, prepend)
- [mixed **$set_value** = FALSE]
  - if want to set value for the element with [form_set_value()](#form_set_value), supply the $data array; FALSE (default) as not using this feature.

**Return Values**

- *String* - of HTML code

**Examples**

  
```php  
echo form_element( 'text' , '' , 'login','Login Name');  
// prints:  
// <div id="form-group_login" class="form-group">

--------


##### get_options_set()

`get_options_set( [$option_set], [$no_result], [$fix_numeric_array] )`

Get the select options set (which was added by [add_options_set()](#add_options_set)). Note: the options set are use by [form_gen_fieldset()](#form_gen_fieldset) automatically and rarely you will need to use this manually.

### datafile

The Datafile helper contains functions that assist in working with data files. You will use keep data in text files instead of in database. Useful if you do not have access to databases or if the application is simple.

You can create many "dataset" (data file) for convenience. Please refer to Settings > [Datafile Helper](#datafile-helper).

Note: for ALL functions which has set to use 'default' dataset, you can simply use a blank string `''` to keep using the default if you need to pass other arguments. (By the aid of [empty_defaults()](#empty_defaults).)

### db

The database helper aids you in connecting and retrieving data from MySQL database, using MySQLi.

This is in essence a library. However this library is NOT very complete. E.g. data escaping is missing in some parts. Need to use with care, but good enough for general use.



--------


#### Database Configuration

Define database configuration(s) in `config/settings.php`, including at least the user name, password, and database name.
```php
// Examples
$db['default'] = array(
	'user'	=> 'user01',
	'pass'	=> 'pass01',
	'db'	=> 'testdb01',
	'port	=> 3306,			// default: 3306 if not set
	'host'	=> 'localhost',		// default: localhost if not set
);
$db['another_set'] = array( ... )
```

**Important**: Do NOT delete the "default" set.

You can define more sets as adding a new key to `$db` as in the example above.



--------


#### Connecting to Database

The default set is automatically connected once the library is loaded. All functions manipulate the data is for the **active** set. If you have multiple set and you want to switch the active set, please use `db_set_active( 'set2' )`. To change back to the default set, simply `db_set_active()`.



--------


##### db_set_active()

`db_set_active( [$db_config] )`

Change active DB connection set.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$db_config** = 'default']
  - DB configuration set name

**Return Values**

- *TRUE* - if the active set is changed
- *FALSE* - otherwise.

**Examples**

  
```php  
db_set_active( 'set2' );		// set to use set2  
db_set_active();				// set to use the default set  
```  




--------


##### db_get_active()

`db_get_active(  )`

Get the name of active data connection set  

**Parameters**

- *nil*

**Return Values**

- *String* - name of the dataset

**Examples**

```php  
echo db_get_active();  
// prints: 'default' or whatever set name you defined  
```  




--------


##### db_connect()

`db_connect( $options )`

Open a connection to database.  
  
Note: You should be using [`db_set_active()`](#db_set_active) instead. Otherwise you cannot make use of the other helpers.  

**Parameters**

- array **$options**
  - array of properties

**Properties**

- string **$user**
  - Database user name
- string **$pass**
  - Database password
- string **$db**
  - Database name
- [string **$host** = 'localhost']
  - DB host name

**Return Values**

- *Object* - mysqli_connect() object

**Examples**

  
```php  
$conn = db_connect( array( 'user' => ... , 'pass' => ... , 'db' => 'testdb' ) );  
```  




--------


#### Running Queries

Please use [`db_query()`](#db_query) for a standard SQL query statement. Otherwise, you can also use [`db_select()`](#db_select), [`db_insert()`](#db_insert), [`db_insert_or_update()`](#db_insert_or_update), [`db_update()`](#db_update), [`db_delete()`](#db_delete) for valid queries. Please refer to the API doc of the functions below.



--------


##### db_query()

`db_query( $sql, [$prep_single], [$keep] )`

Make a SQL query to active database. You can make use of this function for custom SQL statements.  
  
This also serves as a "base" function of other querying methods.  

**Parameters**

- string **$sql**
  - SQL statement to run
- [bool **$prep_single** = FALSE]
  - if return a 1-dimesional result array (refer to [`db_select()`](#db_select) )
- [bool **$keep** = TRUE]
  - keep sql statement for debug (refer to [`db_last_queries()`](#db_last_queries) )

**Return Values**

- *FALSE* - on failure
- *Array* - of data for SELECT query
- *Object* - for SHOW, DESCRIBE or EXPLAIN quries
- *TRUE* - for other successful queries.

**Examples**

  
```php  
$data = db_query( "SELECT * FROM test_table WHERE colA = 1" );  
```  




--------


##### db_select()

`db_select( $select, $from, [$where], [$order], [$prep_single] )`

Select data from active database.  
  
This supports simple and straight forward select statements. For complex logics (e.g. grouping, sub-queries), you will still have to write your own sql queries and make use of [`db_query()`](#db_query).  
  
Note: WHERE values will be automatically escaped. See [`escape()`](#escape).  

**Parameters**

- mixed **$select**
  - SELECT portion, can be string or array (glued by a comma ",")
- mixed **$from**
  - FROM table references, can be string or array (glued by a comma ",")
- [mixed **$where** = '']
  - WHERE condition, can be string or array or associative array (glued by "AND", see usage below )
- [mxied **$order** = '']
  - ORDER BY section, can be string or simple array or associative array (glued by "AND", see usage below )
- [bool **$prep_single** = FALSE]
  - if a single record is expected (so it will be a 1-dimensional array instead of 2-dimensional array) to save some codes. 
  -  Note: if the actual result data is more than 1 row, it will still return a 2-dimensional array)

**Return Values**

- *Array* - query results

**Examples**

1. Simple select query  
```php  
$data = db_select( 'username' , 'users' , array( 'u.username' => 'asc' ) );  
// $data will be an two dimensional array: 1st level is indexed array and 2nd level is associative array:  
// $data = array(  
//		0 => array( 'username' => 'john' ),  
//		1 => array( 'username' => 'jane' ),  
//		2 => ... ,  
// );  
```  
  
2. More complex query  
```php  
$select = array( 'u.username' , 'u.password' , 'p.profilepic' );  
// SELECT u.username, u.password, p.profilepic  
  
$from = 'users u, profiles p';  
// FROM users u, profiles p  
  
$where = array( 'u.username' => $_POST['username'], 'p.password' => crypt( $_POST['password'] ) );  
// WHERE `u.username` = 'user1' AND `u.password` = '$1$q2dljdmO$GOqtv0hxwsbXbeldqYzVp0'  
// key and value is glued by "="  
  
$order = array( 'u.username' => 'asc' );  
// ORDER BY `u.username` asc  
  
$data2 = db_select( $select, $from, $where, $order , TRUE );  
// $data2 will be an associative array (one dimensional).  
// $data2 = array( 'username' => '...', 'password' => '...' , 'profilepic' => '...') ;  
```  
  
3. Here we list other possibilities:  
  
A. It is absolutely fine if you write your own portion in simple strings, for all **$select**, **$from**, **$where**, **$order** parts.  
```php  
$select = 'user,pass';  
// SELECT user,pass  
```  
  
B. No special effect for associative array for **$select** and  **$from**, it will just read the values.  
```php  
$from = array( 'a' => 'table1' );  
// FROM table1  
```  
  
C. It is also fine to use indexed array for **$where** and **$order**, and will be glued with AND. Useful to customized the query.  
```php  
$where = array( 'col1 = "a"', 'col2 !="b"' );  
// WHERE col1 = "a" AND col2 != "b"  
```  
```php  
$order = array( 'col1 asc', 'col2 desc');  
// ORDER BY col1 asc AND col2 desc  
```

--------


### local

The Local helper file is created for your ease to write custom helper functions, especially specific single application. No functions or anything is written here by the framework. This is a just-for-convenience feature. It is fine for you to create new helpers with other names.



--------


### session

Session helper helps in manipulating session in php, as well as adding a "flash data" ability (see "[Flash Data](#flash-data)" section). Instead of helper functions, this is in essence a library for manipulating session. Upon loading the session helper the php session will also be started.



--------


#### Basic Session

We call the basic session "user data" which means the data added to session for user. "Flash data" is some session data that we will only use once and drop after use. However, this is in essence aliases to manipulate with `$_SESSION` superglobals with the exception to hide "flash data" entries. Therefore to use these functions or to use `$_SESSION` directly is up to your preference.



--------


##### set_userdata()

`set_userdata( $key, [$value] )`

Set or update user session data. You may also put an associative array as the only parameter to store multiple session keys at once. (Please see examples for the syntaxes)  

**Parameters**

- Array/String **$key**
  - User data item key or associative array of session items
- [Array/String **$value** = NULL]
  - value to store

**Return Values**

- *Void*

**Examples**

  
```php  
// syntax 1 - single item:   
set_userdata( 'username' , 'john' );  
  
// syntax 2 - multiple items:  
$newdata = array(   
	'username' => 'jane' ,  
	'email' => 'jane@example.com'  
);  
set_userdata( $newdata );  
  
// you can get the session data by: get_userdata('username') and get_userdata('email')  
  
```  

**Changelog**

- 2017.10.17  
	`$key` parameter was renamed from `$data` for clarity  




--------


##### get_userdata()

`get_userdata( [$key] )`

Get user session data.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$key** = `NULL`]
  - User data item key to retrieve. if unspecified (i.e. the default, `NULL`), all user data (in array) will be retrieved.

**Return Values**

- *Array/String* - Vaues of user session data
- *NULL* - if the key is not found

**Examples**

  
```php  
$session_data = get_userdata();  
// get array of all session data (i.e. an alias to $_SESSION, especially when flash data is not used).  
  
$user = get_userdata( 'username ');  
// get a single session item. If it is not set, NULL will be returned.  
// As opposed to $_SESSION, get_userdata will not throw an error if the key is not found.  
```

--------


##### set_flashdata()

`set_flashdata( $key, [$value] )`

Add or change flash data.  

**Parameters**

- array/string **$key**

	'message' => 'Hello World' ,  
	'error' => 'err1'  
);  
set_flashdata( $newdata );  
// you can get the session data by: get_flashdata('message') and get_userdata('error')  
  
  
// common usage example:

## JavaScript
### Usage

To add some custom JavaScript calls, you can either:

1. make use of the [`addjs()`](#addjs) helper if the script if for a single page only; or
2. add in the `js/main.js` if this is going to be site wide.

For plugins, put them in the `js/plugins.js` instead of keeping separate files and link in html head. Best to [compress](http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/) it first and put related basic usage info and link in a doc block before the compressed code.



--------


### Plugins

This list all the basic usage and links related documentation of the plugins and packages already included.



--------


#### Mathjax

`.break-sm/md/lg-down` | break on screen size **which is lower than** specified.<br> i.e. `.break-md-down` will not break on md

Note: those classes of some screen size that look like missing is intended as they are meaningless. E.g. `.break-xs-up` is actually bare `<br>`.

---
**Examples**

```
<br class="break-sm-up">
<br class="break-md">

	- Add to `<table>` if the table does not need any border at all while keeping other styling intact.
		- `<table class="table no-border">`
	- for multiple `<tbody>`, originally it is a 2px border separator. this will also make the border transparent to keep some separation.

## Introduction
### Preface

I loved the [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) framework. However it's getting bulky (it iis still very light-weight, just more than I needed) and not very friendly (to me). And I had to work on a server with php4.01 only (!)(although the support of php4 is continuously removed in this framework) and CI just do not fit. Therefore I referred to CI and write my own simple framework to support my daily works, which includes writing many small websites, mainly form handling and other events websites. This file documents what is going on in using this framework and will probably serve just as a note to myself.

I don't like OO programming much. Therefore in this framework mostly are procedural functions and logic. No MVC, No OOP. Simple and sweet. Perhaps not very sweet, but enough to do my tasks quickly and easily. Although some helpers adopted are really in OO style, I don't really hate it, but I will wrap it as procedural functions.  

What WS stands for? Although this is built for my job, the first completed mini "project" is my personal "WorkSpace".  

-- *written by Alan, Jun 2015*  




--------


### What's Inside

- PHP libraries and helpers
	- mainly procedural functions
- JavaScript plugins
- Scss helpers and plugins
	- including Bootstrap CSS framework Scss files




--------


### License

I did not set any license to this framework for the time being (as of 2015-12-23).  

However, as some functions and code snippets are taken and modified from CodeIgniter and other open-sourced projects, I suppose this should be open-sourced. You may use it under any suitable open-licenses (perhaps MIT license? I am not sure).  

I only claim that as the author of this framework this can be changed at any time without prior notices, and I keep the copyright of this framework, except those functions, scripts or code snippets otherwise specified in the code.

	return TRUE;
}

$tmp = fx1( fx2( fx3( $var1 ) , $var2 ) );

- Brackets, open brackets stick together with its "owner", and 1 space between the "arguments"
- Commas in function are separated with *everything* by 1 space
- Curly brackets in new lines
- Boolean Data Type: TRUE / FALSE / NULL in CAPS

--------


## Using the Framework

As this is a self-defined framework, many stuff has been "pre-defined" and have "opinionated values" (or, simply "hard-coded") to make things work in an efficient way. Therefore, please read the following sections on how to use it.

Note: This framework is built with the support to Bootstrap (v3). Support to v4 is not implemented. Some functions (on displaying content) are normally defined with Bootstrap classes.



--------


### Pages and Segments

All "pages" of the application should goes in the **pages** directory. For instance, create a "test.php" and you can access it in the web by *http://your-site.com/test*. You may also make sub-directories as needed (but this is not very thoroughly tested).  

You can use add argument to the url with `/`.  

Consider this url:  http://your-site.com/test/arg1/hello  

If you do not have the file `/pages/test/arg1/hello.php` but only `/pages/test.php`, then you can access the rest of the url segment as arguments by using `segments()`. In this case, `segments(0)` will return `'arg1'` and `segments(1)` will return `'hello'`. Please refer to [Core > Segments](#segments) section below for details.  



--------


### .htaccess

Please edit the `.htaccess` file in the root of the framework. There are 2 sections which you should modify on each application:



--------


#### RewriteBase

Please search for "RewriteBase" and change the path based on your application root (i.e. where index.php locates). This is essential otherwise the application will just die except the default page.



--------


#### Options to rewrite `www.`

There are two options:  
Option 1: rewrite www.example.com → example.com  
Option 2: rewrite example.com → www.example.com  
Choose one of them and comment out the other section.  



--------




--------


### Templates

The framework applies the same header and footer template to all the page.  
Please edit `header.inc.php` and `footer.inc.php` as needed.  
(Also read [Loader Settings](#loader-settings) section below.)



--------


### index.php

The index.php is served as a "base loader" to load the pages. Do not edit if you are not sure what's going on. Put your application pages in `/pages/` directory.  



--------


#### Multiple Instances

You can have multiple instances of index.php in different directories, and share the same system files. In this framework, we assumes that all these instances belong to the same application with minor settings modifications. On the contrary, if you share the same system files across multiple applications, it will be scary if you need to update the core!



--------


#### Loader Settings

The user adjustable settings are as follows: (in index.php)

--------

**$ws_loader['basepath']**  
Specify the application base path, which is the container directory of "core", "config", "pages" directories. If this is empty, it will use the current index.php file path. You can use relative (to this file) path or absolute path here. Do not put trailing slash. 

Examples:
```php
$ws_loader['basepath'] = '';		// default

$ws_loader['basepath'] = '..';
// parent dir, useful when you put 2nd instance of index.php in sub-directories.
// you can refer to the 2nd example of Page Dir below

$ws_loader['basepath'] = '/var/www/ws';		// absolute path
```

--------

**$ws_loader['pages_dir']**  
Specify the "pages" directory, where the application pages locates. The path is relative to the Application Root path specified above. Do not put trailing slash.

Examples:
```php
$ws_loader['pages_dir'] = '';		// default, which points to "pages"

$ws_loader['pages_dir'] = 'admin';
// if this index.php is a 2nd instance and in a sub-dir called "admin".

```

--------

**$ws_loader['settings']**  
Generally speaking, most of the time you only need a single instance of index.php so that this is not used. However, when you put up a 2nd instance, some times the settings you have made in config.in.php may not be valid / applicable to that instance. Therefore, you need to override it to make it usable. One line for each settings.

Examples:
```php
$ws_loader['settings']['title'] = 'Admin Only Page';
$ws_loader['settings']['valid_users'] = 'Admin';
```

--------

**$ws_loader['incl_header'] / $ws_loader['incl_footer']**  
Specify if you would include header and footer (header.inc.php / footer.inc.php).  By design, this should be enabled.

However this is useful if there is some page in the application that a site header/footer should not be displayed. You will need to write your own includes by using incl().

Please note the styles of 404 page, if you are not including or not using index.

Specify TRUE or FALSE in the variables.

--------


### Pre-defined Variables and Aliases

All system variables begin with `$ws_` prefix. Do not create / overwrite / modify these variables. You can refer to the index.php for a list of system variables.

There are some other pre-defined aliases of variables / constants to simplify your codes:

Var/Const  | Description of the Alias
---------- | ------------------------
`$P`       | (CAPITAL P) alias for `$_POST`
`$G`       | (CAPITAL G) alias for `$_GET`
`$F`       | (CAPTIAL F) alias for `$_FILES`
`$S`       | (CAPITAL S) alias for `$_SERVER`
`DS`       | alias for `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`

Note: What I meant for *alias* here, is that you can keep modifying these variables (e.g. `$P`), while keeping the original one intact (e.g. `$_POST` is unchanged). It is sometimes useful to have 2 copies of the same data to manipulate the program easily. A shorter variable name of these commonly used variables can increase readabilty. For instance, it is clumpsy if the code is flooded with `$_POST['surname']` , `$_POST['name']`, etc. (consider having over 5 or 10 like these), but a bit more readable by `$P['surname']`, `$P['name']`, etc.



--------


### Commonly Used Stuff to Note

- Page Title
	- Use [`set_page_title()`](#set_page_title) to set page title. Useful for pages that you would like an separate page heading. The position is defined in *header.inc.php* with **%PAGE_TITLE%** tag. (i.e., you can use `set_page_title()` anywhere in the page and the title will be set for you)
- Add select options
	- Use [`add_options_set()`](#add_options_set) to add new options. See also [options](#7-options) section in bs_form_helper section.
- Add new JavaScript blocks
	- Use [`addjs()`](#addjs) to add new JavaScript block inline with the program codes in a page. This is required as JavaScript is loaded *AFTER* page content. A `<script></script>` tag will be wrapped for each array item. The scripts are printed in *footer.inc.php* with [`printjs()`](#printjs).



--------


#### CSV, TSV and Array

Array is commonly used in php and in this framework. However, typing arrays sometimes is not very efficient if it is a multi-dimensional array. Thus sometimes tab-separated values (TSV) is used in place of 2-dimensional arrays, with the aid of [`tsv2array()`](#tsv2array) helper. Also, sometimes it is easier to list a set of items in comma-separated values (CSV). Thus, most helper functions supports an auto conversion of csv to array for its arguments (with [`csv2array()`](#csv2array)). That is, if the function's argument requires an array (but not associative array), you can use CSV. However, please check the function's API doc to make sure that.



--------


#### Defaults

Most of the functions have multiple optional arguments. To reduce the use of array parameter, but to skip some optional arguments in the middle, most of the helpers accepts blank string `''` to keep using default values with the introduction of [`empty_defaults()`](#empty_defaults). 




--------

--------




--------


## Config
### settings.php

All settings of the application. Most of the items are self-explanatory in comments.  
Do **NOT** delete any existing variables. Set it to blank `$config['item'] = '';` instead if it is not used.  
Note: This list may not be up-to-date. Please follow what you have in `settings.php`.  
You may also set up any site-wide settings that you can access via `config_item('example_settings')`; Please refer to [`config_item()`](#config_item).



--------


#### Auto-load Helpers

Variable                 | Description
------------------------ | -----------
`$config['helpers']`     | array of helpers to be loaded




--------


#### Title of Application

Variable                 | Description
------------------------ | -----------
`$config['title']`       | Application title, affects how to show in template header and the `<title>` tag in `<head>`
`$config['subtitle']`    | Sub title only shows in header area



--------


#### Datafile Helper
#### Admin Access

To be used by [`valid_user()`](#valid_user).

Variable                 | Description
------------------------ | -----------
`$config['valid_admin']` | Admin user names
`$config['valid_users']` | Normal users, no need to repeat admin user names

<!-- this is the deprecated version.
`$config['admin_ip']`    | IP of authorized users, to access pages protected by `valid_user()` function; *Note*: localhost user is always allowed.
`$config['admin_key']`   | Key to access pages protected by `valid_user()` function. Note that`admin_ip` takes privilege. Append `?v=the_key` to access by admin key. -->




--------


#### Dates

To be used with [`timestr()`](#timestr) / [`time_started()`](#time_started) / [`time_ended()`](#time_ended).  
You may specify any unambiguous date format, e.g. '2015-01-01 12:34'.  
On the contrary, "01-02-2015" is not advised as this could cause confusion on the order of day and month part.  
You can also define you own "date" settings, that the variable ends with '_date'.  
E.g. `$config['test_date'] = '...'`, and access via `timestr('test')`;

Variable                 | Description

## Core

Core is the core library (which in essence also helpers) that the framework will not work without these functions.



--------


### URI Segments

For description of how uri segments work, please see section: [Using the Framework](#using-the-framework).



--------


#### Helper Functions

Note: segments() = csegments() + psegments().  
fsegments() is the superset of segments(). However, fsegments() do not have any portability as it is based on absolute path to the web root, while other "segments" functions rely on relative root to the application.



--------


##### segments()

`segments( [$n], [$no_result] )`

Fetch URI segments based on **application root**.    
Note: it currently has an alias `segment()`, which is deprecated and will be removed.  

**Parameters**

- [mixed **$n** = FALSE]
  - The segment item to return. *0* being the first item.
  - *FALSE* to return an array of ALL segments.
- [bool/mixed **$no_result** = FALSE]
  - What to return if no result.

**Return Values**

- *FALSE* - when segment is not found
- *Mixed* - when segment is not found and has a custom value for `$no_result`
- *String* - uri segment text
- *Array* - array of uri segments text (when `$n == FALSE` which is default)

**Examples**

All functions call with this url: `http://www.example.com/app/test/hello/arg1/arg2`,    
while *test* is the application root, *hello* is the handler page (`pages/hello.php`)  
  
```php  
$segs1 = segments();		// $segs1 = array( 'hello' , 'arg1' , 'arg2' );  
$segs2 = csegments();		// $segs2 = array( 'hello' );  
$segs3 = psegments();		// $segs3 = array( 'arg1' , 'arg2' );  
$segs4 = fsegments();		// $segs4 = array( 'app' , 'test' , 'hello' , 'arg1' , 'arg2' );  
  
echo segments(0);		// prints: hello  
echo segments(1);		// prints: arg1  
echo segments(2);		// prints: arg2  
echo segments(3);		// prints nothing since returns FALSE.  
echo segments(3, 'Not Found');		// prints: Not Found  
  
echo csegments(0);		// prints: hello  
echo csegments(1);		// prints nothing since returns FALSE.  
  
echo psegments(0);		// prints: arg1  
echo psegments(1);		// prints: arg2  
echo psegments(2);		// prints nothing since returns FALSE.  
  
echo fsegments(0);		// prints: app  
echo fsegments(1);		// prints: test  
echo fsegments(2);		// prints: hello  
echo fsegments(3);		// prints: arg1  
echo fsegments(4);		// prints: arg2  
echo fsegments(5);		// prints nothing since returns FALSE.  
```  




--------


##### csegments()

`csegments( [$n], [$no_result] )`

Similar to `segments()`, except that this returns segments based on the **<u>c</u>urrent** page.

This is useful if your application is nested under a sub-directory.  
  
Please note that `fsegments()` does not have portability as it relies on web root instead of application root. For instance, if you move the application into a deeper sub-directory, it will have different returns.  
  
Please refer to [segments()](#segments) for details of parameters, return values and examples.  

**Parameters**

- [mixed **$n** = FALSE]

- [bool/mixed **$no_result** = FALSE]





--------


##### site_url()

`site_url( [$uri] )`

Make a proper full web address of the URI based on the **application root** defined in index.php.

- [string **$uri** = '']
  - URI to check and set

**Return Values**

- *String* - the complete url

**Examples**

```  




--------


##### current_url()

`current_url( [$uri] )`

Make a proper full web address of the URI based on **current page url**.  
Useful for pages in sub-folder (`pages/folder1`) with assets under the same sub-folder.

- If the uri has a scheme (e.g. http:// ) , it will not be prep'd.  
- If no uri is inputted, the base url will be returned.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$uri** = ""]
  - URI to check and set

**Return Values**

- *String* - the complete URL

## Main

The main helpers contains a mix of useful functions that should be most needed by all applications, and some base functions for other functions to rely on.

This is currently put in helpers category, but in essence this is like in a mix of core and helper. Therefore this is moved out as a separate section so as for easy reference.

(The differences of "core" & "main" is defined by, if those in "main" is missing, the framework would still runs, probably in reduced functionality, while missing those in "core" cannot and the framework will die immediately.)



--------


### Development Functions

**Examples**

  
```php  
echob( 'a','b' );  
// prints:

### Time Related Functions
##### timestr()

`timestr( [$type], [$format] )`

Return a string of the time type in specified date format.     
The time types are defined in [settings.php - date section](#dates).  
  
This time string is useful in time comparisons.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$type** = '']
  - Time type defined in `settings.php`. If this is *empty*, returns string as of the time now. You can also specify custom date here directly if you are not using the time types defined. (see examples below)
- [string **$format** = YmdHis]
  - Php [date format](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php "PHP date&#40;&#41;") to output

**Return Values**

- *String* - of formatted time
- *FALSE* - if the type is not set or the custom date is invalid.

**Examples**

  
```php  
echo timestr();		// echo time now (e.g. 201512121234)  
echo timestr( 'start' );		// echo 201512311338  
echo timestr( 'end' , 'Y-m-d H:i');		// echo 2015-12-31 13:38  
echo timestr( '2015-1-23 12:34');		// echo 201501231234  
```  




--------


##### time_started()

`time_started( [$type] )`

Checks if current time is already past the specific time.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$type** = 'start']
  - Time type defined or custom date (refer to [`timestr()`](#timestr) )

**Return Values**

- *TRUE* - if the time already past
- *FALSE* - otherwise

**Examples**

  
```php  
if( ! time_started() )  
	echo "Application period is not yet started.";  
```  




--------


##### time_ended()

`time_ended( [$type] )`

Checks if current time is still not yet past the specific time.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$type** = 'end']
  - Time type defined or custom date (refer to [`timestr()`](#timestr) )

**Return Values**

- *TRUE* - if the time is still not yet past
- *FALSE* - otherwise

### Miscellaneous Functions
##### die_nicely()

`die_nicely( [$text], [$caption], [$include_header] )`

Die nicely with styles. Useful to show simple error message immediately without having the need to make a new page.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$text** = '']
  - Error message content to display (wrapped with `<p>`)
- [string **$caption** = '']
  - Error message caption to display (wrapped with `<h2>`).
- [bool **$include_header** = FALSE]
  - Include header.inc.php if *TRUE* - since `header.inc.php` already included before loading the page file, the use is very limited before header is included by index.php. For instance, making a custom library and this is called before `header.inc.php` is loaded. However, if this is called too early before main helper is loaded, this function will fail to be called anyway (PHP error). 
  -  No effect if `$ws_loader['incl_header']` is FALSE. 
  - NOTE: footer is always included; again if `$ws_loader['incl_footer']` is FALSE, footer will not be included.

**Return Values**

- *Void*

**Examples**

  
```php  
if( ! valid_user() )  
{  
	die_nicely( 'You are not allowed to access this page.' , 'Access Denied');  
}  
```  




--------


##### get_require()

`get_require( $filename )`

**Parameters**

- string **$filename**
  - file path and name

**Return Values**

- *String*

**Examples**

  
```php  
$result = get_require( '/some/path/to/file' );  
```  




--------


##### empty_default()

`empty_default( $value, $default )`

Returns default value if input value is empty (check with `empty()`).  

**Parameters**

- string **$value**
  - Input value to be checked if it is empty. Note that this is passed by reference. (`&$value`)
- string **$default**
  - Default value to set to the input variable if it is empty

**Return Values**

- *Void*

**Examples**

  
```php  
$str = '';  
empty_default( $str , '123' );		// $str = '123'  
$str2 = '456';  
empty_default( $str2 , '123' );		// $str2 = '456'  
```  




--------


##### html()

`html( $element, [$attributes], [$html_close_comment] )`

Prepare a html element.    
  
Note: This is not an intelligent function. You must give instructions if that is a self-closing element or is an element with close tag. Defaults to self-closing element (i.e. no close tag will be made).  

**Parameters**

- string **$element**
  - Element name to be printed. E.g. a, form, input, etc.
- [array **$attributes** = '']
  - Any attributes to be printed inside the open tag. Sub array items can also be array. For details please refer to [`_print_attributes()`](#_print_attributes). You may also specify '' (blank) for $attributes if no attributes to add if you need close comment (below).
- [bool **$html_close_comment** = FALSE]
  - If *TRUE*, add a html comment after close tag to make view source better. Text to add is from id and class attributes (see examples). No effect for self-closing elements.

**Return Values**

- *String* - html code generated

**Examples**

  
  
Basic usage:  
```php  
echo html( 'a' , array( 'href' => 'www.example.com', 'title' => 'Hover Text'), 'Test Website');  
// Prints: <a href="www.example.com" title="Hover Text">Test Website</a>  
  
echo html( 'div' , array( 'id' => 'div1' ) , "Test" , '/ #div1');  
// Prints: <div id="div1">Test</div> <!-- / #div1 -->  
  
echo html( 'img', array( 'src' => 'test.png' );  
// Prints: <img src="test.png">  
  
echo html( 'div', array( 'class' => 'myclass' , '' );  
// Prints: <div class="myclass"></div>  
```  
What makes this function really useful is you can modify the attributes array before generating the tag:  
```php  
$attr = array( 'class' => 'myclass' );  
if( $P['a'] == FALSE )  
{  
	$attr['class'] => 'yourclass';  
}  
echo html( 'div' , $attr , 'Sample Text' );  
// if $P['a'] is really false:  
// prints: <div class="yourclass">Sample Text</div>  
```  
You can also wrap html() into another html() just like a chain:  
```php  
echo html( 'div' , '' ,   
		html( 'h4' , '' ,   
			html( 'a' , $attr, 'A link in a h4 in a div')  
		)  
	);  
```

  - If *TRUE*, add a html comment after close tag to make better view source. Text to add is from id and class attributes. No effect for self-closing elements. 
  - **Note:** different from [`html()`](#html) where the default is *FALSE*

**Return Values**

- *String* - html code generated

**Examples**

  
```php  
echo div( html( 'p' , '' , 'Hello World!') );

## Helpers

Helpers, as the name suggests, help you with tasks. Each helper file is a collection of functions in a particular category. Helper files located in `./helpers/`. All helper file names should ends with `_helper.php`, e.g. `array_helper.php`.

To load a helper in a page, use `load_helper( 'helper_name' );` (e.g. `load_helper('array');`). To auto-load a helper for the whole site, add the name of helper(s) in `$config['helpers']` in `settings.php`.

Since most likely we will have our own helper functions in each application (and for that specific application), a blank `local_helper.php` is here and set to auto-load by default.

### array

We deal with arrays a lot so the array helpers are here to help.



--------


##### tsv2array()

`tsv2array( $data, [$has_header], [$row_key], [$delimiter], [$convert_spaces] )`

Convert tab-separated values string to 2-dimensional array. If the data supplied is already an array, does nothing.  
  
Note: you can use `//` to comment out a row in a data for convenience.  

**Parameters**

- string **$data**
  - Delimited string data to be converted
- [bool **$has_header** = TRUE]
  - TRUE to make first array item as the key of the 2nd level array (and the first item will be removed in the array)
- [bool/string **$row_key** = TRUE]
  - If *TRUE*, search for `'id'` field (opinionated value) as the 1st level array keys. 
  -  If *FALSE*, keep numeric 1st level array keys. 
  -  If *string*, search for identifier field as specified in this value and make it as 1st level array keys. Otherwise, the first level array keys are numeric. For example, if your id field is named "row_id", you can pass this string for this parameter, so that the first level keys are properly named to make it into an associative array. Note: if same key value exists, the later ones will have the original numeric key appended after the key value, so that data will not be overwritten and appears as separate array item.
- [string **$delimiter** = "\t"]
  - Column delimiter character.
- [bool **$convert_spaces** = TRUE]
  - If *TRUE*, convert 4 consecutive spaces to tabs before conversion. Editors may replace tabs with spaces automatically.

**Return Values**

- *Array* - of data (2-dimentional array)

**Examples**

  
```php  
$data = tsv2array('  
id	name	title  
john	John Doe	Mr.  
jane	Jane Doe	Ms.  
// 3	This Record is Commented Out  
');  
  
print_r($data):  
// prints:  
// Array  
// (  
//     [john] => Array  
//         (  
//             [id] => john  
//             [name] => John Doe  
//             [title] => Mr.  
//         )  
//

### bs_form

The Bootstrap Form helper contains a standard use case to help creating forms in Bootstrap style easily. This was developed from an old form helper, which is now deprecated and removed in favour of the use of Bootstrap framework).

Please study the basics of Bootstrap framework before you can use these helpers properly.



--------


#### Standard Use Case

The helper is developed with the consideration of "fieldsets" with multiple fields in a fieldset. Therefore, instead of manually creating form fields individually, we can make use of an array of settings of the fieldset in tab seperated values (TSV). Consider the following code snippet:

```php
$fs1 = tsv2array('

echo form_gen_fieldset( form_set_values( $fs1, $P ), '' , $form_type );
echo form_submit( '' , $form_type );
echo form_fieldset_close();
echo form_close();
```

(Note: the number are here to help counting the tabs)

This code block creates a form with the 2 fields (sid, password), in B's horizontal form style.
The use of TSV minimizes the typing required, although in essence the functions accepts array as input. Therefore, you can also modify the array first before generating the form fields.

For the data to input in the TSV is discussed below. You can reorder the TSV, just to change order the column header in the way you prefer.

Please also refer to [`tsv2array()`](#tsv2array) in **arrays** helper. Also, please read below sections for explanations of each helper functions.

For horizontal form type, you can specify the width of label, e.g. `horizontal-6`. The element width would be the remaining width. Otherwise, for site-wide label width, you can modify the constant `HORIZONTAL_FORM_LABEL_WIDTH` in `config/constants.php`.

Please also note that there is a global form disabled state switch. Please refer to [form_disabled()](#form_disabled) for details. However, you can completely ignore it if you do not need this functionality.



--------


##### 1. id

The unique id and the name of the field.

Note: if you have to specify id and name differently, use [html()](#html) to create your own tag as this is out of the standard use case.



--------


##### 2. label

Text label to be displayed. For radio and checkbox, this will be the group label (not the label next to the select option).

If no label tag should be created, put **FALSE** as value.



--------


##### 3. type

The following describes the form element types available in this helper:

type | Description
--- | ---
hidden | a hidden field. *label* attribute has no effect
select | Standard select list make use of `<option>` tags.
select-radio | List of options in radio buttons. Only 1 option can be chosen.
select-checkbox | List of options in checkboxes. Multiple options can be made.
static | text wrapped in `<p>` tag. Specify the text in *value* attribute. The text is aligned on the element side. Note: *label* does still prints and you still need to give an unique *id* although this is not printed.
html | plain html code to output. Specify the code in *label* or *value* attribute. If both attributes are specified, *label* takes precedence and the other discards.
textarea | Standard textarea. Default *rows* = 2. Specify *rows* value in *options* (this is a special case)
checkbox | Single checkbox. Use *desc* attributes to specify text next to the checkbox.
file| Standard file upload field
text | Standard text field
All other valid HTML5 input types | Those input types must begin with `<input`.

See [7. options](#7-options) section below for select options.

Note: There is no type for a single radio option as this is not helpful at all.



--------


##### 4. validate

Add a validation class. In this framework we make use of the [jquery-validationEngine plugin](http://posabsolute.github.io/jQuery-Validation-Engine/ "Complete docs here").

Separate validation rules with comma (,).

Some common validation rules are listed below:

Rule [Keyword / E.g.] | Description
--- | ---
required | A required field
min[0.1] / max[99] | Specify min / max value of the field (value)
minSize[1] / maxSize[200] | Specify min / max character length
custom[email] | valid email address (e.g. test@example.com)
custom[phone] | valid phone (e.g. 30561309, 6543-1234, +58 295416 7216)
custom[url] | valid url address (e.g. http://..., https://..., ftp://...)
custom[date] | valid date (YYYY-MM-DD)
custom[number] | floating points (with optional sign) (e.g. -143.22, .77 , +234.23)
custom[integer] | integers (with optional sign) (e.g. -635, +2201, 738)
ipv4 | An IP (v4) address (e.g. 127.0.0.1)

Note: Multiple "custom" rules are separated with commas with square brackets. e.g. custom[phone,integer]



--------


##### 5. desc

Descriptive text show next to (or under - depends on form type) the field.



--------


##### 6. placeholder

Placeholder text show inside the field, when it is empty.



--------


##### 7. options

This attribute has effect only on the 3 select types. (Special: *options* can also specify the *rows* attribute of *textarea*, just put an integer as options for textarea.)

Options is an array with `value => description` pair in essence. However, to work nicely with TSV, you may also use `value1||desc1, value2||desc2` syntax.

- value: the value to be captured in data
- desc: the text to be shown to user on the select list / checkboxes / radio.



--------


###### a. select options


```php
add_options_set( 'options1', array(
	'1'=>'One' , '2'=>'Two',
) );
$data = tsv2array('
// 1 2 ... 7
id	label ... options
sid	Year ... $options1
');
```

There is a pre-defined `$ws_select_options` variable. You can add item in this array using [`add_options_set()`](#add_options_set) and then specify `$options1` as the option value.

To add a select option easily, you can create the options array first and then use `add_options_set()`. This is also good for those selects with same options set

Two commonly used options has been pre-defined:

1. status (same value&label: Active / Inactive / Deleted )
2. bool (value=>label: Y=>Yes / N=>No )





--------


###### b. serialized  json encoded array

The options can be specified using the `serialize()` or `json_encode()`functions. Either one is fine and the system will detect.

```php
$options1 = array('1'=>'One' , '2'=>'Two');
) ) );
$data = tsv2array('
// 1 2 ... 7
id	label ... options
sid	Year ... ' . serialize( $options1 ) . ' ...
num	Number ... ' . json_encoded( $options1 ) . '...
');
```



--------


###### c. value-desc pair

Specify in the TSV with pre-defined separator: "`||`" (two vertical bar, or <kbd>shift-\</kbd>). This is useful for simple lists.

On the other hand, for a even more simpler list (the value and desc is the same), simply put csv there.

```php
$data = tsv2array('
// 1 2 ... 7
id	label ... options
year	Year ... 1||One,2||Two ...
age	Age	..	14,15,16,17,18
');
```




--------


##### 8. extra

Any extra stuff to put *in* the field's tag. This is not filtered (except we will `trim()` and then add one space in front to the string). You can even put JavaScript call here, examples:  
`disabled`
`onclick="somescript();"`  



--------


##### 9. value

Value (initial value) of the field. For checkbox and radio the one with the value will be set checked.



--------


##### 10&11. append & prepend

Any text or code to append or prepend to the field, using [B's input group addon functionality](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#input-groups-basic).



--------

```  




--------


##### form_close()

`form_close( [$text] )`

Produces a closing `</form>` tag. The only advantage to use this function is it permits you to pass data to it which will be added directly below the tag and you do not have to close php blocks.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$text** = '']
  - html code or text to add immediately after the close tag is ended `</form>\n$text...`

**Return Values**

--------


##### form_gen_fieldset()

`form_gen_fieldset( $fields, [$legend], [$form_type], [$attributes] )`

Generate a fieldset with form fields in Bootstrap style.  
  
In essence, this function is simply a combination call of `form_fieldset_open()` and `form_gen_elements()`. However, to streamline the use case of the form helper, this function is essential.  
  
Note: All elements will have an auto-id generated. For instance, if the id of the field is *field1*, then the `<label>` will have an id *label_field1*, the field element (`<input>`,`<textarea>`, etc.) will have id *field1*. For select options, an auto number will be added, e.g. *field1-1* (starting from 1). There will be an auto id for input group div as well.  

**Parameters**

- array/string **$fields**
  - data of the fieldset. See [Standard User Case](#Standard-Use-Case) section.
- [string/bool **$legend** = '']
  - Text to show as the caption of the fieldset. Specify *FALSE* if no need to create the fieldset tag: `<fieldset>`.
- [enum **$form_type** = '']
  - Bootstrap form type ( '' / horizontal / inline ) 
  -  If $form_type is *horizontal*, you can also specify the label width e.g. *horizontal-4*
- [array **$attributes** = array()]
  - attributes add to fieldset open tag (e.g. id, class, ...)

**Return Values**

- *String* - html code of the whole fieldset (or fields)

**Examples**

  
```php  
$fs1 = tsv2array('  
...  
');  
echo form_gen_fieldset( $fs1, '' , $form_type );  
```  




--------


##### form_fieldset_open()

`form_fieldset_open( [$legend], [$attributes] )`

- [array **$attributes** = array()]
  - Attributes to print in `<fieldset>` tag, e.g. id, class, etc.

**Return Values**

- *String* - of HTML code

**Examples**

  
```php  
echo form_fieldset_open();

**Parameters**

- array **$field**
  - field array (single field)
- array **$data**
  - values array (e.g. data from post or database)

##### form_disabled()

`form_disabled( [$value] )`

This function has two uses (see examples):  
1. Making all form elements in disabled state (or not).  
	- Note: This is a global switch. Meaning that you can change this settings once and change for all fields.  
	- Default disabled state is FALSE. (i.e. you can completely ignore this function if you do not need this.)  
2. Returns the string `disabled` if form is in "disabled" state. (this use is designed for form field helper functions to set the disabled state.)  

**Parameters**

- [bool **$value** = '']
  - Set if the form should be disabled. 
  -  If the value is empty, it returns the string `disabled` if form is in disabled state.

**Return Values**

- *Void* - if setting disabled state (use 1)
- *String/Null* - (use 2)

**Examples**

  
```php  
// for use 1:  
form_disabled( TRUE );		// init  
if( time_started() AND ! time_ended() )  
	form_disabled( FALSE );

- 2016-02-05  
	- renamed from `save_file()` for clarity. Rewritten for its major flaws in original version.  




--------


##### get_data()

`get_data( [$dataset], [$key_field] )`

Get all records from data file as an array, with the first row as array keys.  
  
This is *a helper of helpers*. That is you can achieve the same result by using together with `[open_datafile()](#open_datafile)`, `[array_header_to_keys()](#array_header_to_keys)`, `[make_data_assoc()](#make_data_assoc)`.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$dataset** = 'default']
  - the dataset to be used which defined in `settings.php`
- [string **$key_field** = FALSE]
  - key field to make the data array to be an associative array. *FALSE* (default) to keep it numeric.

**Return Values**

- *Array* - of data retrieved (2-dimensional)
- *FALSE* - if the dataset does not exist

**Examples**

  
```php  
$data = get_data();  
$data = get_data( 'set1' );  
$data = get_data( 'set2', 'user_id' );  
```  




--------


##### get_active_data()

`get_active_data( [$dataset], [$active_key], [$key_field] )`

An extension to [`get_data()`](#get_data). This returns "active" data only.  
  
The value of "active" field must not be evaluated as *FALSE* or *empty*: i.e. 0, NULL, FALSE, and `''` (blank).  

**Parameters**

- [string **$dataset** = 'default']
  - the dataset to be used which defined in `settings.php`
- [string **$active_key** = 'active']
  - the field to be used to evaluate the record is active or not; Default 'active' is an opinionated field name.
- [string **$key_field** = FALSE]
  - key field to make the data array to be an associative array. *FALSE* (default) to keep it numeric.

**Return Values**

- *Array* - of data retrieved (2-dimensional)
- *FALSE* - if the dataset does not exist

**Examples**

  
```php  
$data = get_active_data( 'set1' );  
$data = get_active_data( 'set2', 'status' , 'user_id' );  
```  




--------


##### add_record()

`add_record( $data, [$dataset], [$audit_fields] )`

Prep data and append a single record to data file.  
  
This function will auto *remove* `submit` key in the data array, and *add* `uniqid` (unique id), `date_added`, `ip_addr` attributes. Also add header row if this file is empty. This is useful for saving form results.  
  
This is a *helper of helpers*, which calls [`array_header_to_keys()`](#array_header_to_keys), [`prep_for_datafile()`](#prep_for_datafile), and [`save_datafile()`](#save_datafile).  

**Parameters**

- array **$data**
  - Data to be saved, in array of `key => value` pairs
- [string **$dataset** = default]
  - the dataset to be used which defined in `settings.php`
- [bool **$audit_fields** = TRUE]
  - add audit fields (Unique ID, Date Added, IP Address) values to the record. 
  -  "Unique ID" is generated by `uniqid()` 
  -  "Date Added" is the system date and time when the record is added 
  -  "IP Address" is the user's IP address.

**Return Values**

- *Int* - number of bytes saved (evaluates to TRUE)
- *FALSE* - if the dataset does not exist

**Examples**

  
```php  
$data = array( 'id' => '12345' , 'name' => 'John Doe' )  
$result = add_record( $data );		// if default set  
```  

**Changelog**

- 2016-01-21  
	- Changed name from `save_record()` for clarity.  




--------


##### update_record()

`update_record( $key_field, $key_field_value, $new_data, [$dataset], [$backup], [$update_key_field_value] )`

Update ONE record in the dataset.  
  
Note that it will check against the current data columns. If a column does not exist, the value will not be added to the row; On the other hand, if the existing column is not exist in new data, the old values will be kept.  

**Parameters**

- string **$key_field**
  - key field of the data. Can be *FALSE* if intended to use numeric dataset
- string **$key_field_value**
  - key field value of the record to be updated (must be unique, otherwise, will update the first record in the data file)
- array **$new_data**
  - array of data to be updated (`key=>value` pairs)
- [string **$dataset** = 'default']
  - Dataset to use
- [bool **$backup** = FALSE]
  - Backup data file before update. (See [`backup_dataset()`](#backup_dataset))
- [bool **$update_key_field_value** = FALSE]
  - If the key field value should be updated if the key field exists in $new_data. This is handy as you do not need to remove the key field in the data array beforehand

**Return Values**

- *Int* - for successful updates, number of bytes of data file saved after updates
- *FALSE* - if the dataset is not found
- *NULL* - if the record is not found

**Examples**

- 2016-01-21  
	- Added $key_field to use.  




--------


##### add_header_from_keys()

`add_header_from_keys( $data )`

Add a header row to the data. Headers are read from the first array item.  
  
Basically a reverse of [array_header_to_keys()](#array_header_to_keys). You may use it before saving data to a dataset. If the sub-item of the input array is not an associative array, does nothing.  

**Parameters**

- array **$data**
  - data to be saved in array of `key => value` pairs

**Return Values**

- *Array*

**Examples**

  
```php  
$data = array(

--------


### db

The database helper aids you in connecting and retrieving data from MySQL database, using MySQLi.

This is in essence a library. However this library is NOT very complete. E.g. data escaping is missing in some parts. Need to use with care, but good enough for general use.



--------


#### Database Configuration

Define database configuration(s) in `config/settings.php`, including at least the user name, password, and database name.
```php
// Examples
$db['default'] = array(
	'user'	=> 'user01',
	'pass'	=> 'pass01',
	'db'	=> 'testdb01',
	'port	=> 3306,			// default: 3306 if not set
	'host'	=> 'localhost',		// default: localhost if not set
);
$db['another_set'] = array( ... )
```

**Important**: Do NOT delete the "default" set.

You can define more sets as adding a new key to `$db` as in the example above.



--------


#### Connecting to Database

The default set is automatically connected once the library is loaded. All functions manipulate the data is for the **active** set. If you have multiple set and you want to switch the active set, please use `db_set_active( 'set2' )`. To change back to the default set, simply `db_set_active()`.



--------


##### db_set_active()

`db_set_active( [$db_config] )`

Change active DB connection set.  

**Parameters**

- [string **$db_config** = 'default']
  - DB configuration set name

**Return Values**

- *TRUE* - if the active set is changed
- *FALSE* - otherwise.

**Examples**

  
```php  
db_set_active( 'set2' );		// set to use set2  
db_set_active();				// set to use the default set  
```  




--------


##### db_get_active()

`db_get_active(  )`

Get the name of active data connection set  

**Parameters**

- *nil*

**Return Values**

- *String* - name of the dataset

**Examples**

```php  
echo db_get_active();  
// prints: 'default' or whatever set name you defined  
```  




--------


##### db_connect()

`db_connect( $options )`

Open a connection to database.  
  
Note: You should be using [`db_set_active()`](#db_set_active) instead. Otherwise you cannot make use of the other helpers.  

**Parameters**

- array **$options**
  - array of properties

**Properties**

- string **$user**
  - Database user name
- string **$pass**
  - Database password
- string **$db**
  - Database name
- [string **$host** = 'localhost']
  - DB host name

**Return Values**

- *Object* - mysqli_connect() object

**Examples**

  
```php  
$conn = db_connect( array( 'user' => ... , 'pass' => ... , 'db' => 'testdb' ) );  
```  




--------


#### Running Queries

Please use [`db_query()`](#db_query) for a standard SQL query statement. Otherwise, you can also use [`db_select()`](#db_select), [`db_insert()`](#db_insert), [`db_insert_or_update()`](#db_insert_or_update), [`db_update()`](#db_update), [`db_delete()`](#db_delete) for valid queries. Please refer to the API doc of the functions below.



--------


##### db_query()

`db_query( $sql, [$prep_single], [$keep] )`

Make a SQL query to active database. You can make use of this function for custom SQL statements.  
  
This also serves as a "base" function of other querying methods.  

**Parameters**

- string **$sql**
  - SQL statement to run
- [bool **$prep_single** = FALSE]
  - if return a 1-dimesional result array (refer to [`db_select()`](#db_select) )
- [bool **$keep** = TRUE]
  - keep sql statement for debug (refer to [`db_last_queries()`](#db_last_queries) )

**Return Values**

- *FALSE* - on failure
- *Array* - of data for SELECT query
- *Object* - for SHOW, DESCRIBE or EXPLAIN quries
- *TRUE* - for other successful queries.

**Examples**

  
```php  
$data = db_query( "SELECT * FROM test_table WHERE colA = 1" );  
```  




--------


##### db_select()

`db_select( $select, $from, [$where], [$order], [$prep_single] )`

Select data from active database.  
  
This supports simple and straight forward select statements. For complex logics (e.g. grouping, sub-queries), you will still have to write your own sql queries and make use of [`db_query()`](#db_query).  
  
Note: WHERE values will be automatically escaped. See [`escape()`](#escape).  

**Parameters**

- mixed **$select**
  - SELECT portion, can be string or array (glued by a comma ",")
- mixed **$from**
  - FROM table references, can be string or array (glued by a comma ",")
- [mixed **$where** = '']
  - WHERE condition, can be string or array or associative array (glued by "AND", see usage below )
- [mxied **$order** = '']
  - ORDER BY section, can be string or simple array or associative array (glued by "AND", see usage below )
- [bool **$prep_single** = FALSE]
  - if a single record is expected (so it will be a 1-dimensional array instead of 2-dimensional array) to save some codes. 
  -  Note: if the actual result data is more than 1 row, it will still return a 2-dimensional array)

**Return Values**

- *Array* - query results

**Examples**

1. Simple select query  
```php  
$data = db_select( 'username' , 'users' , array( 'u.username' => 'asc' ) );  
// $data will be an two dimensional array: 1st level is indexed array and 2nd level is associative array:  
// $data = array(  
//		0 => array( 'username' => 'john' ),  
//		1 => array( 'username' => 'jane' ),  
//		2 => ... ,  
// );  
```  
  
2. More complex query  
```php  
$select = array( 'u.username' , 'u.password' , 'p.profilepic' );  
// SELECT u.username, u.password, p.profilepic  
  
$from = 'users u, profiles p';  
// FROM users u, profiles p  
  
$where = array( 'u.username' => $_POST['username'], 'p.password' => crypt( $_POST['password'] ) );  
// WHERE `u.username` = 'user1' AND `u.password` = '$1$q2dljdmO$GOqtv0hxwsbXbeldqYzVp0'  
// key and value is glued by "="  
  
$order = array( 'u.username' => 'asc' );  
// ORDER BY `u.username` asc  
  
$data2 = db_select( $select, $from, $where, $order , TRUE );  
// $data2 will be an associative array (one dimensional).  
// $data2 = array( 'username' => '...', 'password' => '...' , 'profilepic' => '...') ;  
```  
  
3. Here we list other possibilities:  
  
A. It is absolutely fine if you write your own portion in simple strings, for all **$select**, **$from**, **$where**, **$order** parts.  
```php  
$select = 'user,pass';  
// SELECT user,pass  
```  
  
B. No special effect for associative array for **$select** and  **$from**, it will just read the values.  
```php  
$from = array( 'a' => 'table1' );  
// FROM table1  
```  
  
C. It is also fine to use indexed array for **$where** and **$order**, and will be glued with AND. Useful to customized the query.  
```php  
$where = array( 'col1 = "a"', 'col2 !="b"' );  
// WHERE col1 = "a" AND col2 != "b"  
```  
```php  
$order = array( 'col1 asc', 'col2 desc');  
// ORDER BY col1 asc AND col2 desc  
```

Session helper helps in manipulating session in php, as well as adding a "flash data" ability (see "[Flash Data](#flash-data)" section). Instead of helper functions, this is in essence a library for manipulating session. Upon loading the session helper the php session will also be started.



--------


#### Basic Session

We call the basic session "user data" which means the data added to session for user. "Flash data" is some session data that we will only use once and drop after use. However, this is in essence aliases to manipulate with `$_SESSION` superglobals with the exception to hide "flash data" entries. Therefore to use these functions or to use `$_SESSION` directly is up to your preference.



--------


##### set_userdata()

`set_userdata( $key, [$value] )`

Set or update user session data. You may also put an associative array as the only parameter to store multiple session keys at once. (Please see examples for the syntaxes)  

**Parameters**

- Array/String **$key**
  - User data item key or associative array of session items
- [Array/String **$value** = NULL]
  - value to store

**Return Values**

- *Void*

**Examples**

  
```php  
// syntax 1 - single item:   
set_userdata( 'username' , 'john' );  
  
// syntax 2 - multiple items:  
$newdata = array(   
	'username' => 'jane' ,  
	'email' => 'jane@example.com'  
);  
set_userdata( $newdata );  
  
// you can get the session data by: get_userdata('username') and get_userdata('email')  
  
```  

**Changelog**

- 2017.10.17  
	`$key` parameter was renamed from `$data` for clarity  




--------


##### get_userdata()

`get_userdata( [$key] )`

Get user session data.  

**Parameters**

- *NULL* - if the key is not found

**Examples**

$session_data = get_userdata();  
// get array of all session data (i.e. an alias to $_SESSION, especially when flash data is not used).  
  
$user = get_userdata( 'username ');  
// get a single session item. If it is not set, NULL will be returned.  
// As opposed to $_SESSION, get_userdata will not throw an error if the key is not found.

## JavaScript
### Usage

To add some custom JavaScript calls, you can either:

1. make use of the [`addjs()`](#addjs) helper if the script if for a single page only; or
2. add in the `js/main.js` if this is going to be site wide.

For plugins, put them in the `js/plugins.js` instead of keeping separate files and link in html head. Best to [compress](http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/) it first and put related basic usage info and link in a doc block before the compressed code.



--------

--------


#### Responsive Line Breaks

Class | Description
---   | ---
`.break-xs/sm/md/lg`   | break **ONLY** on that screen size
`.break-sm/md-up`      | break on that screen size **and** higher
`.break-sm/md/lg-down` | break on screen size **which is lower than** specified.<br> i.e. `.break-md-down` will not break on md

Note: those classes of some screen size that look like missing is intended as they are meaningless. E.g. `.break-xs-up` is actually bare `<br>`.

<br class="break-sm-up">
<br class="break-md">
<br class="break-lg-down">
```

#### Table

Added the follow classes:

- `.no-border`
	- Add to `<table>` if the table does not need any border at all while keeping other styling intact.
		- `<table class="table no-border">`
	- for multiple `<tbody>`, originally it is a 2px border separator. this will also make the border transparent to keep some separation.
