`segments( [$n], [$no_result] )`  
Fetch URI segments based on **application root**.  
Note: it currently has an alias `segment()`, which is deprecated and will be removed.  

**Parameters**

- [mixed **$n** = FALSE]
	- The segment item to return. *0* being the first item. 
	  *FALSE* to return an array of ALL segments.
- [bool/mixed **$no_result** = FALSE]
	- What to return if no result.
	
**Return Values**

- *FALSE* - when segment is not found;   
- *Mixed* - when segment is not found and has a custom value for `$no_result`;  
- *String* - uri segment text;  
- *Array* - array of uri segments text (when `$n == FALSE` which is default);  


**Examples**

All functions call with this url: `http://www.example.com/app/test/hello/arg1/arg2`,  
while *test* is the application root, *hello* is the handler page (`pages/hello.php`)
