I loved the [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) framework. However it's getting bulky (it iis still very light-weight, just more than I needed) and not very friendly (to me). And I had to work on a server with php4.01 only (!) and CI just do not fit (although the support of php4 is continuously removed in this framework). Therefore I referred to CI and write my own simple framework to support my daily works, which includes writing many small websites, mainly form handling and other events websites. This file documents what is going on in using this framework and will probably serve just as a note to myself.

I don't like OO programming much. Therefore in this framework mostly are procedural functions and logic. No MVC, No OOP. Simple and sweet. Perhaps not very sweet, but enough to do my tasks quickly and easily. Although some helpers adopted are really in OO style, I don't really hate it, but I will wrap it as procedural functions.

What WS stands for? Although this is built for my job, the first completed mini "project" is my personal "WorkSpace".
