I did not set any license to this framework for the time being (as of 2015-12-23).  

However, as some functions and code snippets are taken and modified from CodeIgniter and other open-sourced projects, I suppose this should be open-sourced. You may use it under any suitable open-licenses (perhaps MIT license? I am not sure).  

I only claim that as the author of this framework this can be changed at any time without prior notices, and I keep the copyright of this framework, except those functions, scripts or code snippets otherwise specified in the code.
