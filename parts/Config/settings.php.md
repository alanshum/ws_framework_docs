All settings of the application. Most of the items are self-explanatory in comments.  
Do **NOT** delete any existing variables. Set it to blank `$config['item'] = '';` instead if it is not used.  
Note: This list may not be up-to-date. Please follow what you have in `settings.php`.  
You may also set up any site-wide settings that you can access via `config_item('example_settings')`; Please refer to [`config_item()`](#config_item).
