Array is commonly used in php and in this framework. However, typing arrays sometimes is not very efficient if it is a multi-dimensional array. Thus sometimes tab-separated values (TSV) is used in place of 2-dimensional arrays, with the aid of [`tsv2array()`](#tsv2array) helper. Also, sometimes it is easier to list a set of items in comma-separated values (CSV). Thus, most helper functions supports an auto conversion of csv to array for its arguments (with [`csv2array()`](#csv2array)). That is, if the function's argument requires an array (but not associative array), you can use CSV. However, please check the function's API doc to make sure that.
