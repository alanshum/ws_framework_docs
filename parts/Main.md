The main helpers contains a mix of useful functions that should be most needed by all applications, and some base functions for other functions to rely on.

This is currently put in helpers category, but in essence this is like in a mix of core and helper. Therefore this is moved out as a separate section so as for easy reference.

(The differences of "core" & "main" is defined by, if those in "main" is missing, the framework would still runs, probably in reduced functionality, while missing those in "core" cannot and the framework will die immediately.)
