The Datafile helper contains functions that assist in working with data files. You will use keep data in text files instead of in database. Useful if you do not have access to databases or if the application is simple.

You can create many "dataset" (data file) for convenience. Please refer to Settings > [Datafile Helper](#datafile-helper).

Note: for ALL functions which has set to use 'default' dataset, you can simply use a blank string `''` to keep using the default if you need to pass other arguments. (By the aid of [empty_defaults()](#empty_defaults).)
