We call the basic session "user data" which means the data added to session for user. "Flash data" is some session data that we will only use once and drop after use. However, this is in essence aliases to manipulate with `$_SESSION` superglobals with the exception to hide "flash data" entries. Therefore to use these functions or to use `$_SESSION` directly is up to your preference.
