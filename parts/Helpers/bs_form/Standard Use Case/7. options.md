This attribute has effect only on the 3 select types. (Special: *options* can also specify the *rows* attribute of *textarea*, just put an integer as options for textarea.)

Options is an array with `value => description` pair in essence. However, to work nicely with TSV, you may also use `value1||desc1, value2||desc2` syntax.

- value: the value to be captured in data
- desc: the text to be shown to user on the select list / checkboxes / radio.
