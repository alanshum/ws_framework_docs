The debug helpers is for all debugging tasks for development, maintenance and profiling.

**IMPORTANT**

If the `$config['debug_mode']` setting is set to `FALSE`, nothing will be printed by ANY of the functions in this helper.

This is for easy debugging and you can simply leave the debug helper functions in the scripts and simply turn the debug mode off when the program is ready to put in production.
